# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- **tool/python** (roadmap deliverable 5): pane's persistent IPython
  kernel, ported. One kernel per session; state (variables, imports, defs)
  survives across calls. Stdlib only: `os/exec` and the kernel's
  JSON-lines protocol over stdio, no third-party client; the host is
  pane's `kernel_host.py` verbatim, embedded and materialised on demand
  (pane's installed path preferred for interop, the choice logged at
  startup). Interpreter is pane's shared venv; the lazy bootstrap
  (single-flight, re-tryable, verbatim voice) is the default path's
  policy — `LOOPER_PYTHON` is the operator's explicit interpreter and the
  `NewWith` seam's contract is no bootstrap. Timeout kills the whole
  kernel and says so (pane's voice, half-up rounding); an unexpected death
  is announced on the next call once, with exit description and stderr
  tail; a deliberate restart leaves no note. Protocol state is per process
  (no stale buffer, no stderr leak); first-writer-wins delivery; EPIPE
  fails fast; `Setpgid`/`WaitDelay`/group kill. Pane's 21 named cases pass
  against a real kernel in pane's order; the suite skips cleanly on a bare
  box.
- **tool/scheduler** (roadmap deliverable 4): background jobs on the
  user's crontab, ported from pane. Two stores (global, per-workspace) with
  the event-log spine and `jN` ids never reused; crontab as the scheduling
  truth (tagged lines, surgical rewrites, foreign lines byte-identical,
  written before the store commit, drift surfaced in `list`); 5-field
  vixie validation and `once` + `at`; the `runs` container as the audit
  read. The runner is looper's own `run-job <key>` verb: flock per key,
  busy policy against llama-swap (`skip` | `force`, own-slot-loaded runs,
  unreachable fails closed), spawn under a timeout with process-group kill,
  run records and logs (newest 20), a once job consumed after its fire.
  Workers are `looper -p` with the swap endpoint passed explicitly; the
  default `-base-url` now matches the swap (8090).
- **`-p` one-shot mode** (`frontend/oneshot`): one prompt in, the response
  on stdout, faults propagate to a non-zero exit so a run record cannot
  log false success. Borrowed from roadmap deliverable 7 to give the
  scheduler its worker.
- **tool/rem** (roadmap deliverable 3): memory, ported from pane. learn
  (idempotent on scope + content md5), recall (FTS5 and trigram arms fused
  by reciprocal rank at k=60, effective strength at read, project-first
  with global fill, live-hit budget), reflect (distilled memory with its
  raw source), prune (consolidate as the checkpointed pass, remove/reduce
  by selection). Ids minted from a meta counter, never reused;
  supersession SET NULL cleared by prune in the same transaction; FTS and
  trigram rows written in code, no orphans; `AutoReflect` shipped for
  compaction to wire. `memories.source` defaults to the calling session id,
  free text allowed.
- **store/state** (SPEC_STATE): the session transcript as rows. `sessions`,
  `messages`, `tool_calls`, `usage`, `files`, `faults` in a workspace-shared
  sqlite file; a recorder on the Frontend and middleware seams lands every
  completed row inside its own short transaction, so a killed worker leaves
  its autopsy. `core.Session.ID` minted at `NewSession` and shared by the
  loop and the transcript.
- **store/**: the substrate under all of the above. lift-generated domain
  and DDL from hand-written four-tag metadata (`gen.json` with the runtime
  field; lift gained it, and portable `IN`-list batch getters, in the
  process), `sqlx` and `lazy` copied verbatim, `Open` with pragmas riding
  the DSN (`_txlock=immediate`, WAL, busy_timeout, foreign_keys on every
  pooled connection), schema version check, corruption quarantined aside,
  a generation-drift test per store. `modernc.org/sqlite` is the one
  require line.

- **tool/todo** (roadmap deliverable 2): the task-queue store — pane's
  semantics, Go over the generated substrate. Claim semantics (start
  claims, foreign complete/start refuses and names the claimer, fail
  frees); completion gated by dependencies with the blocker named, cycles
  refused with the path, blocked tasks skipped by next; move via
  minted-position events; auto-compaction past the threshold, the
  snapshot first; the stale footer; workspace isolation per working
  directory. Concurrent writers serialize at the database level:
  up-front write locks and per-connection pragmas carried in the DSN. The
  generated domain/DDL runs under the drift guard; extra.sql applied via
  `Statements() = DDL + the extra`.

- **tool/fs** (roadmap deliverable 1): named `ls`, `find`, `grep` beside
  bash/read/write/edit. Stdlib only; `.git` and binary skips; unreadable
  entries counted and named (`[skipped: N unreadable]`), an unreadable root
  stays a loud error; result caps named in the output, matched-line text
  capped at 512 bytes; bare find patterns match by name, the find -name
  reading; ctx honored at the walk boundary.
- **`Description` on the wire**: `core.Tool.Description()` +
  `ToolSpec.Description`, carried by the OpenAI adapter as
  `function.description`; descriptions take the house voice. The default
  allow-list grows to the seven-tool set.

## [0.1.0] — initial release

Shipped through the stacked-review process: each slice landed on its parent,
gated on `go test ./...` / `go vet ./...` / `gofmt -l`, merged down-stack.

- **core + loop** — the typed seams (`Provider`, `Tool`, `Frontend`,
  `ContextPolicy`, `ToolMiddleware`), wire types, the streaming-event
  vocabulary, versioned session JSON with provenance and exec records, the
  composition kernel, and the concrete turn runtime: faults (provider,
  transport, *and* a failing context assembly) surface through `Notify`,
  abort the turn, and leave the session intact; cancelled steps surface
  cleanly; a stream closed without Done or Fault fails loudly.
- **provider/openai** — the SSE streaming adapter over `net/http`: finish-
  marker gated delivery, tool-call accumulation by choice index, tool schemas
  transmitted as JSON objects, non-2xx and truncation surfaced as faults.
- **tool/bash** — `bash(1)` execution with induced-work bounds: 256 KiB
  output cap (truncation named), `WaitDelay` so background children cannot
  hold the turn, and process-group teardown on cancellation.
- **tool/file** — read/write/edit with `FileState` provenance, path-
  normalized drift checking (external modification named and refused;
  ambiguity refused, never guessed at), and a 1 MiB read cap.
- **middleware** — `policy` passthrough (day-one `ContextPolicy`); `perm`
  allow-list, deny-by-default at the boundary with attributed denials;
  `guard.Bound` — every call executes exactly once; the model's re-issuance
  of an identical failing call is counted across turns (name plus args
  digest), refused without executing at the bound, and cleared on success.
- **frontend/cli** — the stdin/stdout REPL over the `Frontend` seam: plain,
  greppable rendering; blank lines no-op; Ctrl-C cancels the turn at its next
  boundary and the session survives.
- **cmd/looper** — the composition root: `looper.New(...)` wires every seam
  in one call; configuration via flags or `LOOPER_*` env, no config files;
  `--version` reports the release.
