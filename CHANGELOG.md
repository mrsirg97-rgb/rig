# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- **tool/todo** (roadmap deliverable 5): the task-queue store — pane's
  semantics, Go over the generated substrate. Claim semantics (start
  claims, foreign complete/start refuses and names the claimer, fail
  frees); completion gated by dependencies with the blocker named, cycles
  refused with the path, blocked tasks skipped by next; move via
  minted-position events; auto-compaction past the threshold, the
  snapshot first; the stale footer; workspace isolation per working
  directory. Concurrent writers serialize at the database level:
  up-front write locks and per-connection pragmas carried in the DSN. The
  generated domain/DDL runs under the drift guard; extra.sql applied via
  `Statements() = DDL + the extra`.

- **tool/fs** (roadmap deliverable 1): named `ls`, `find`, `grep` beside
  bash/read/write/edit. Stdlib only; `.git` and binary skips; unreadable
  entries counted and named (`[skipped: N unreadable]`), an unreadable root
  stays a loud error; result caps named in the output, matched-line text
  capped at 512 bytes; bare find patterns match by name, the find -name
  reading; ctx honored at the walk boundary.
- **`Description` on the wire**: `core.Tool.Description()` +
  `ToolSpec.Description`, carried by the OpenAI adapter as
  `function.description`; descriptions take the house voice. The default
  allow-list grows to the seven-tool set.

## [0.1.0] — initial release

Shipped through the stacked-review process: each slice landed on its parent,
gated on `go test ./...` / `go vet ./...` / `gofmt -l`, merged down-stack.

- **core + loop** — the typed seams (`Provider`, `Tool`, `Frontend`,
  `ContextPolicy`, `ToolMiddleware`), wire types, the streaming-event
  vocabulary, versioned session JSON with provenance and exec records, the
  composition kernel, and the concrete turn runtime: faults (provider,
  transport, *and* a failing context assembly) surface through `Notify`,
  abort the turn, and leave the session intact; cancelled steps surface
  cleanly; a stream closed without Done or Fault fails loudly.
- **provider/openai** — the SSE streaming adapter over `net/http`: finish-
  marker gated delivery, tool-call accumulation by choice index, tool schemas
  transmitted as JSON objects, non-2xx and truncation surfaced as faults.
- **tool/bash** — `bash(1)` execution with induced-work bounds: 256 KiB
  output cap (truncation named), `WaitDelay` so background children cannot
  hold the turn, and process-group teardown on cancellation.
- **tool/file** — read/write/edit with `FileState` provenance, path-
  normalized drift checking (external modification named and refused;
  ambiguity refused, never guessed at), and a 1 MiB read cap.
- **middleware** — `policy` passthrough (day-one `ContextPolicy`); `perm`
  allow-list, deny-by-default at the boundary with attributed denials;
  `guard.Bound` — every call executes exactly once; the model's re-issuance
  of an identical failing call is counted across turns (name plus args
  digest), refused without executing at the bound, and cleared on success.
- **frontend/cli** — the stdin/stdout REPL over the `Frontend` seam: plain,
  greppable rendering; blank lines no-op; Ctrl-C cancels the turn at its next
  boundary and the session survives.
- **cmd/looper** — the composition root: `looper.New(...)` wires every seam
  in one call; configuration via flags or `LOOPER_*` env, no config files;
  `--version` reports the release.
